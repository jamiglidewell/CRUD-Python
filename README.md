# CRUD-Python


About the Project/Project Title
This project is the creation of a dashboard related to the animals at a shelter.  This system will be a web application that performs allows users to search and filter through dogs for various purposes.  The database will provide staff at the shelter with information that helps them understand the attitude of the dogs and categorizes them as what actions to take with the dog.

Motivation
This project exists to allow users to identify and recognize animals that might be a good fit for their needs, either pet or search and rescue training.  The purpose of the project is to allow the user to search through a database of dogs at the shelter and filter based on multiple criteria that would return a result of an animal that fits their unique needs.  This increases the chances that a dog can be identified by a potential owner for adoption.

Getting Started
To get started with this project you should open the project dashboard.  This will allow you make changes to the selection boxes and choose the type of animal that you want to select.


Installation
Installing the tools requires a Python method to initiate the dashboard

Usage
This project takes advantage of multiple Python commands to initiate the dashboard and search through the MongoDB for an adequate dog.  

Roadmap/Features (Optional)
Functionality will be added to the system with time as business needs change.

**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the 
dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
**

By making sure that there are no hard coded features, code can be maintained, easy to read, and adaptable to changes.  It is good to make strong comments in code as well so that
we know what work is doing what things.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your 
approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client 
requests?

I want to make sure I consider all of the possible problems that my code might encounter before I start working.  I looked at the specific requirements of th eGrazioso Salvare 
project before I started working on them to make sure that I covered everything.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are responsible for solving problems with computer programs.  This work helps other companies do their work better by making every day tasks easier.
